#Project 2 - H1.
##1. THEME
    The theme is pretty straight forward to begin with. It's going to revolve around the great city of pawnee indiana. I think
    there will eventually be a more developed or refined theme. 
    
##2. KNOWN PROBLEMS:
1.User List:
  1. The user list is non existant right now. I will have it implemented fully in the future. I am having an issue with 
  2. pulling user information from my database. I have it, and I have a user id being returned currently. 
2.CSS:
  1. Given more time I could have made the application more responsive to window resizing. As  
     is right now there could be some improvements to formatting.
3. MISC:
  1. For some reason when a new user connects, all other user's messages are sent with the new user's user id.
  2. The application does not display the chat window until the page has been refreshed after someone has logged in.


##IMROVEMENTS:
1.THEME:
  1. There could be more elements revolving around pawnee and actual user images. Also resizing the window should also resize the entire application. 
2.APPEARANCE:
  1. I would have just wanted it to be have a unified style.
3. EVERYTHING:
  1. I want to improve everything.
